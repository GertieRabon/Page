# DS-Clinic
DS Clinic is a responsive website designed for Dlorah Dental Orthodontic Clinic.
It aims to provide a simple and accessible way for patients to book dental appointments online, learn more about the services offered, and contact the clinic easily.
While the clinic already has a social media presence, the website serves as a more professional and centralized platform that shows the clinicâ€™s credibility, implements proper appointment booking, and improves the clinic's overall online visibility.
